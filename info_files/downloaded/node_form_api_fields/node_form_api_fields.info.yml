name: Node Form API Fields
type: module
description: >
  This module allows you to add fields to an node edit screen via the Form API. 
  It automatically stores submissions from your Form API fields using the 
  Drupal 8 Key Value storage rather than creating tables for each field. Useful 
  for one-off fields that you want to avoid growing the complexity of the 
  database for.
